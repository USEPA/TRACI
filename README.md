## About
Software/Secondary Data and its intended application
The EPA National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) has developed TRACI – the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts – to provide the impact assessment framework, methodologies, and associated factors to allow assessment of various impact categories. The impact categories selected for inclusion within TRACI are considered a minimal set that may be expanded with future versions. The associated work will support further development of the basic research underlying the taxonomy of comprehensive impact assessment, the impact assessment methodologies and associated factors, case studies, and normalization.
