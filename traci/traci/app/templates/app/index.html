            Software/Secondary Data and its intended application The EPA National Risk Tool for
            Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) has developed TRACI – the Reduction and
            Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts – to provide the impact
            assessment framework, methodologies, and associated factors to allow assessment
            of various impact categories. The impact categories selected for inclusion within
            TRACI are considered a minimal set that may be expanded with future versions. The
            associated work will support further development of the basic research underlying
            the taxonomy of comprehensive impact assessment, the impact assessment methodologies
            and associated factors, case studies, and normalization.
